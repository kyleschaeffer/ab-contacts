## Development Notes

* This solution works great on any device and in any browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari); out of respect for the time constraints of the project, I have not optimized the Internet Explorer experience

* I would normally organize JS and SCSS into modules with a build process to compile everything into a browser-friendly solution; due to the "no frameworks" requirement for this project, I decided to use pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; comments within each file should help with navigation

* Some FontAwesome icon substitutions were made (lightweight fonts were not available)

* Please feel free to let me know at any time if you have any questions; thank you for this opportunity!
